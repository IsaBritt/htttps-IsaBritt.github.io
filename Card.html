                <h1>Hello! Welcome to my Website</h1>
                <p>I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer, looking for more experience to further my skills as a whole. Either
                    through internship or learning on the job.</p>
                <P> Hopefully, this will be a career starter for me and I expand outside of full stack development, since I am
                    also curious to learn Data Science and possibly Cybersecurity.</P>
                    <p><em>Career Objective: </em> Motivated IT beginner from Nigeria with a WAEC certificate, high school graduate
                    and a current undergraduate for Computer Science with a strong interest in gaining practical hands-on
                    experience in the IT sector, specifically in Software Engineering.</p>
                <p> I am currently seeking an internship to expand my knowledge and experience to prepare for a long-term
                    training and a possible long-term career in an European Country.</p>

                    <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>Due to the uprise of AI, the chances of employment have been dulled as a result, as many companies seem to
                    perceive it as a way to lessen the need for recruiting people and revenue to pay people.</p> 
                <p>AI is impressive but it can't replace the creative aspect that is associated with the human mind and
                    behaviour. I may not have the most knowledge or understanding of AI, since I am not really into it. I admit
                    I use it but not more for analysis than anything else. I will neither deny using it, because I admit that I do.
                </p>
                <p>However, it doesn't think for me. I think what scares me the most is how everyone views Arifical Intelligence as
                    the best thing and should therefore be used more. If we want to use it in the world of medicine and helping with
                    people with rare yet equally deadly conditions, that will be fine. But it doesn't possess the idea of trial and
                    error, having access to databases computer scientists have documented in over the years.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="articlecontent">
                    <p>At the end of the day, it seems like Aritifcal Intelligence is still dependent on human intelligence, so we are
                        simply going around in circles. By reusing recorded foundings as our own, which means we aren't involving.</p>
                    <p>From my point of view, at least. The point I am trying to make across on a topic I have little interest knowledge
                        or
                        interest in, is that that lack of failures encourages later years to become lazy, as nothing in the history of
                        humanity hasn't blossomed from the concept of failing and learning from their failure in the proceess.</p>
                    <p>For example, like how I am a beginner. It's obvious with how I am choosing a simple website to paint that point
                        across. I don't have that much experience in this but my effort with this wesbite on my own without any use of
                        tools, means I can learn and make adjusts in it. Allowing me to figure out my style in using user interaction
                        and
                        design for front-end.</p>
                    <p>It is a shortcut to lessen accidents and disasters but incapable of replacing skills that take effort and
                        creativity. Hand-on-hand skills, e.g carpentry & sewing. Communicative jobs, e.g dancers, teachers & writers.
                        Even languages are there, many are using it to learn foreign languages. My parent recommend I use it, but
                        honestly, I would not like to do so. Language is a cultural heritage for many, it's a bridge of connection and
                        should be respected for it. Language has history and history can easily fade away when people don't take time to
                        understand it's roots and focuses on AI to replace their practical thinking instead. </p>
